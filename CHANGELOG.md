## v1.0.1

- Landing buttons: nudged upward to align centers with the bannerâ€™s bottom edge across breakpoints.
- Banner: anchored image to bottom (`object-bottom`) for better focal point with reduced height.
- Banner height: reduced to half, then increased by 50px for better balance (final heights: 200/300/350/400px).
- Removed horizontal blue divider lines under the banner and buttons.

Notes:
- Build remains configured for Node.js 20 via `amplify.yml` to fix Amplify CLI 14 engine requirements.
